An ok discord bot

## Setup

Setting up the bot is simple. 

You must have *preferably latest* Python 3 & pip to use the bot.

- Modify `config.json` to contain the required tokens ([osu!](https://old.ppy.sh/p/api), [Discord](https://discord.com/developers/applications/))
- Install required packages using pip: (most Linux distros: `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`, most Windows installs: `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- Start the bot: (most Linux distros: `python3 index.py`, most Windows installs: `python index.py`)

If you are trying to keep the bot up constantly, I'd recommend using tmux.
